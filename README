PBKB: Peptide bioactivity kernel based

This package contains tools to learn peptide bioactivity predictor and find the peptides that maximize the output of the predictor

-------
How to install
-------

To ease the utilization, we have programmed a pure python implementation and very optimized version of this work in Cython that is faster than the pure python version.

To install this module (*recommended*), simply run the following command:
> pip install -e PBKB
